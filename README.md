### Hi, I'm Darryl 👋

I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer based in the UK 🇬🇧.

- 🔭 I’m currently creating Ecommerce 🛒 solutions using Next.js.
- 📚 Currently improving my Typescript and plan to learn C# soon.
- 👯 I’m looking to help you with your Ecommerce site or API and other interesting Web Projects.
- 😍 Outside of coding I enjoy motorbikes 🏍️, cycling 🚵 and getting out into the countryside 🥾.
